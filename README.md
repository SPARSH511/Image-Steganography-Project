# Image-Steganography-Projects
My two projects about image steganography done during the Cryptography and Network Security course. First one is a Tkinter based application which utilises LSB Technique to hide textual data inside images and the other one is a collab notebook showcasing how to hide textual data inside images using GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks).
